# Implementation-of-Round-Robin
Round-robin (RR) is one of the algorithms employed by process and network schedulers in computing. As the term is generally used, time slices also known as time quanta are assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority . Round-robin scheduling is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free.
